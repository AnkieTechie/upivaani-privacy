  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to the UPI Vaani - Voice of every transaction app (hereinafter referred to as "Application") developed by Ankit Kushwaha ("Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is provided "AS IS".</p>

  <h2>App Overview</h2>
  <p>This app provides voice alerts for UPI transaction messages. It features 2-3 skippable onboarding screens to explain key features. To continue using the app, users must accept this privacy policy by ticking a checkbox. No registration or login is required.</p>

  <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>

  <h3>User Provided Information</h3>
  <p>This Application does not require you to register or create an account. Therefore, no personally identifiable information is collected directly from you through registration.</p>

  <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>The Application may collect certain information automatically, such as device type, device ID, IP address, OS version, browser type, and usage behavior within the app. This helps improve the app experience but does not include personally identifiable data.</p>

  <h3>Notification Access and Local Data Usage</h3>
  <p>The Application requires notification access to read UPI transaction messages like sender name, amount, date, and time. This data is only stored locally on your device using a Room Database and is not transmitted or shared externally.</p>

  <h3>Location Information</h3>
  <p>This Application does <strong>not</strong> collect, use, or share any location information (precise or approximate).</p>

  <h3>Internet Access</h3>
  <p>Internet access is used for update checks or error reporting but no personal or transactional data is sent online.</p>

  <h3>Analytics and Advertising</h3>
  <p>No analytics or advertising services are used. The app is free from third-party trackers.</p>

  <h3>Third-party Access</h3>
  <p>The app uses Google Play Services, which may have its own data handling policy. See below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Opt-out Rights</h3>
  <p>You can stop all data collection by uninstalling the app from your device at any time.</p>

  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>All data from notifications is stored only locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes all data permanently. The Service Provider does not store or retain any data on external servers.</p>

  <h3>Children</h3>
  <p>The app is not intended for children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>Data is stored only on your device. No data is sent to servers, minimizing risk. However, device-level security (screen lock, encryption) is recommended for further protection.</p>

  <h3>User Consent for Notification Access</h3>
  <p>By granting notification access, you consent to the Application reading your UPI transaction messages to provide voice alerts. This permission can be revoked anytime from your device settings.</p>

  <h3>Changes</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be published on this page. Continued use of the app means you accept these changes.</p>

  <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2025-06-10.</p>

  <h3>Your Consent</h3>
  <p>By using the Application and ticking the checkbox to accept this Privacy Policy, you agree to the terms outlined here and any future updates.</p>

  <h3>Contact us</h3>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:contact.upivaani@gmail.com">contact.upivaani@gmail.com</a>.</p>
