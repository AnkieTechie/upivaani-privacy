  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to the UPI Vaani – Voice of Every Transaction app or Your All Pay Voice (“Application”), developed by Ankit Kushwaha (“Service Provider”) and provided as a free service. Use of this Application is subject to the terms below.</p>

  <h2>App Overview</h2>
  <p>This Application provides voice alerts for UPI transaction messages. It includes a few skippable onboarding screens and requires user acceptance of this Privacy Policy to continue. No registration or login is required.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>

  <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
  <p>The Application does not require account creation or personal identification. No personally identifiable information is collected from the user.</p>

  <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>Some non-personal technical data such as device type, OS version, and usage behavior may be collected for the sole purpose of improving functionality. This data is not linked to any user identity and is not shared.</p>

  <h3>Notification Access and Local Storage</h3>
  <p>The Application reads UPI transaction messages (e.g., sender, amount, date, time) via Notification Access. This data is stored only locally on the user's device using Room Database. No data is uploaded, transmitted, or shared externally.</p>

  <h3>Auto-Start on Boot</h3>
  <p>The Application offers an optional setting to start automatically when the device boots. This is disabled by default and can be manually enabled/disabled by the user. No data is collected during this process.</p>

  <h3>Location Data</h3>
  <p>The Application does <strong>not</strong> request, access, or use location data of any kind.</p>

  <h3>Internet Usage</h3>
  <p>Internet access is used solely for basic app functions like update checks or error logs. No personal or transactional data is sent or stored online.</p>

  <h3>Analytics and Ads</h3>
  <p>The Application does not use any analytics tools or serve ads. It is completely free of third-party tracking or advertising SDKs.</p>

  <h3>Third-party Services</h3>
  <p>The Application uses Google Play Services, which may have its own data handling policies. Learn more:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Opt-out Rights</h3>
  <p>You may stop all collection and use of information by the Application at any time by uninstalling it from your device.</p>

  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>All collected data is stored locally and permanently removed upon uninstallation. No data is stored on any external servers or cloud infrastructure.</p>

  <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
  <p>The Application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect any data from them.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>
  <p>All app data is stored on your device. While the Application does not transmit data, users are encouraged to enable device-level security (e.g., screen lock, encryption).</p>

  <h3>User Consent</h3>
  <p>By granting Notification Access, you consent to the Application reading your UPI messages for the purpose of providing local voice alerts. This permission can be revoked anytime via system settings.</p>

  <h3>Policy Updates</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised as required. Changes will be posted here. Continued use of the app implies acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-06-10</p>
